### Algorithm practice with Typescript (JavaScript)

```bash
nvm use && npm i # install dependencies
npm test         # run tests for all solutions by default
```

### To Practice

- Don't look at solution files `src/*-solution.ts`
- In each tests `/tests/*.ts`, comment out the imports from solution and uncomment the non-solution imports.
- Write your solution in TODO in each practice file, and run the tests to check if your solution works
